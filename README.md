🚀 Products Project: Modern E-commerce Web Application
A modern e-commerce web application built with Next.js 14 (App Router), React, and TypeScript. This project demonstrates best practices for scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web development. It features a responsive UI, robust state management, and comprehensive testing, making it a solid foundation for a production-ready e-commerce platform.

✨ Features
Product Catalog: Dynamic display of products with detailed views, including color and storage selectors.

Performance Optimization:

Image Optimization: Leverages Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization and lazy loading.

Server Components: Utilizes Next.js Server Components for improved performance and SEO.

Accessibility (A11y): Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a great user experience for all. Includes semantic HTML, meaningful alt text for images, and keyboard navigability.

Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using SCSS Modules for scoped and maintainable styles.

State Management: Efficient Context API for global state management, particularly for cart functionalities.

Testing: Comprehensive testing suite covering various layers:

Unit Tests: Jest and React Testing Library for isolated component and logic testing.

Integration Tests: Verifying interactions between components and overall UI behavior.

Accessibility Tests: Automated accessibility checks using jest-axe to catch violations early.

Code Quality: Enforced with ESLint for static code analysis and Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Custom Scrollbar: Implements simplebar-react for a custom, cross-browser consistent scrollbar experience.

✨ Best Practices & Design Principles
Next.js Image Component: Always use this component for optimized image delivery. 🖼️

Accessibility First: Prioritize semantic HTML and provide meaningful alt text for all images to ensure an inclusive user experience. ♿

Robust Testing: Maintain high code quality and prevent regressions with comprehensive unit, integration, and accessibility tests. ✅

SCSS Modules: Utilize CSS Modules with SCSS for component-scoped styles, preventing global style conflicts. 💅

Separation of Concerns: Keep business logic (state management, data fetching) in custom hooks or context providers, separate from presentational UI components. 🏗️

Code Consistency: Enforce consistent code style and formatting using ESLint and Prettier. ✨

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for API calls and component rendering (e.g., notFound() for missing products). 🛑

Responsive Design: Components are built with mobile-first and responsiveness in mind. 📱💻

🚀 Deployment
This Next.js application is designed for easy deployment. It can be deployed on platforms like Vercel (the creators of Next.js) or any other platform that supports Node.js applications and static site generation (if applicable). ☁️
