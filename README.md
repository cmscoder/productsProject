# 🚀 Products Project: Modern E-commerce Web Application

A modern e-commerce web application built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. This project demonstrates best practices for scalable, maintainable, and high-performance web development. It features a responsive UI, robust state management, and comprehensive testing, making it a solid foundation for a production-ready e-commerce platform.

## ✨ Features

- **Product Catalog**: Dynamic display of products with detailed views, including color and storage selectors.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - **Image Optimization**: Leverages Next.js `Image` component for automatic image optimization and lazy loading.
  - **Server Components**: Utilizes Next.js Server Components for improved performance and SEO.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**: Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a great user experience for all. Includes semantic HTML, meaningful `alt` text for images, and keyboard navigability.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using **SCSS Modules** for scoped and maintainable styles.
- **State Management**: Efficient **Context API** for global state management, particularly for cart functionalities.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite covering various layers:
  - **Unit Tests**: Jest and React Testing Library for isolated component and logic testing.
  - **Integration Tests**: Verifying interactions between components and overall UI behavior.
  - **Accessibility Tests**: Automated accessibility checks using `jest-axe` to catch violations early.
- **Code Quality**: Enforced with **ESLint** for static code analysis and **Prettier** for consistent code formatting.
- **Custom Scrollbar**: Implements `simplebar-react` for a custom, cross-browser consistent scrollbar experience.

## ✨ Best Practices & Design Principles

- **Next.js `Image` Component**
  Always use this component for optimized image delivery. 🖼️

- **Accessibility First**
  Prioritize semantic HTML and provide meaningful `alt` text for all images to ensure an inclusive user experience. ♿

- **Robust Testing**
  Maintain high code quality and prevent regressions with comprehensive unit, integration, and accessibility tests. ✅

- **SCSS Modules**
  Utilize CSS Modules with SCSS for component-scoped styles, preventing global style conflicts. 💅

- **Separation of Concerns**
  Keep business logic (state management, data fetching) in custom hooks or context providers, separate from presentational UI components. 🏗️

- **Code Consistency**
  Enforce consistent code style and formatting using ESLint and Prettier. ✨

- **Error Handling**
  Implement robust error handling for API calls and component rendering (e.g., `notFound()` for missing products). 🛑

- **Responsive Design**
  Build components with mobile-first responsiveness in mind. 📱💻
